// mass is normalized to unity (does not appear explicity in the equations),
// and the driving force is writtin in units of spring constant, so a static force
// of X will cause the oscillator come to rest at X
//
// The oscillator parameters are
//   W0 (undampened resonant frequency) ... the user sets this in Hz (as F0)
//   Q  (quality factor)
//
// In addition, the ocillator can be configured as a (two-pole) lowpass or high filter,
// since these circuits are directly analogous to harmonic oscillators.

// note that the two-pole lowpass Bessel, the rise time (for a step) and
// and impulse response width are approx tau/2.0, or 1/(2*w0):
//  a tau = 1 is w0 (and wc) of TWO_PI
//  this has a rise time / impulse response of about 0.4
// (i.e., the intergration time is about 0.4 * tau)
