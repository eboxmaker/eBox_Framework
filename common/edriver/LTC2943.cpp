LTC2943: Multicell Battery Gas Gauge with Temperature, Voltage and Current Measurement.
LTC2943-1: Multicell Battery Gas Gauge with Temperature, Voltage and Current Measurement.

@verbatim

The LTC2943 measures battery charge state, battery voltage,
battery current and its own temperature in portable
product applications. The wide input voltage range allows
use with multicell batteries up to 20V. A precision coulomb
counter integrates current through a sense resistor between
the battery’s positive terminal and the load or charger.
Voltage, current and temperature are measured with an
internal 14-bit No Latency ΔΣ™ ADC. The measurements
are stored in internal registers accessible via the onboard
I2C/SMBus Interface
